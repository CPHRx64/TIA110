###IMPORTANT###
1. The applicaiton uses bluetooth and unfortunately the emulator doesn't support that so it only runs on real physical android devices.

2. We use a paid API key for the application and will attach the api key in the submission to avoid leaking it to the internet.
  
  
--WHERE TO PUT THE API KEY--
In the file MainActivity.kt, go to line 16 and replace the empty string called "api_key" with the API key. Complile MainActvity.kt to run the application.
